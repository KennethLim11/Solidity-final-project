# Solidity-final-project
 
This solidity program allows us to create our own very simple smart contract with some functionality. 

# Description
In this program, we can mint tokens, burn tokens, and see the description and supplies of the tokens. Public Variables were use to store information about the token while functions were used to mint or burn the tokens. 

# Executing the program
To execute the program, we ran it on the Remix IDE which is an online Solidity IDE.
